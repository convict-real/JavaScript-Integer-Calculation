# JavaScript Integer Calculation

An integer calculation system, meant to check if a number is positive, zero, or negative, in different ways, because even though I have never written a line of javascipt code in my life except right now, alot of javascript "developers" dont even know how to do this :skull: so whatever I guess.

### NO DEPENDENCIES NEEDED
I didn't have to use any dependencies to do this unlike these javascript clown developers because i'm competent and able to code my own shit in a language I dont even know lol

### Information
* Written using Emacs 29 Demo
